# Thuong Le

Hi there 👋, I am Thuong. I am a software engineer, specializing in mobile application development.

Recently, I work mostly with [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), [Java](https://www.java.com/en), [Dart](https://dart.dev), and other mobile technologies and libraries.

I love learning new stuff and doing things that make positive impacts around me. 

I value diversity, equality, and freedom. I believe in the power of compound interest, and I try to be a little better version of myself every day.

Outside the technology world, I enjoy quality time with my family and friends, listening to audiobooks, and looking for investment opportunities.
